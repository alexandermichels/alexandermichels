I am a research assistant at the [CyberInfrastructure & Geospatial Information Laboratory (CIGI)](http://www.cigi.illinois.edu/) and [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/). My research is focused on CyberGIS; utilizing and developing high-performance and scalable software and cyberinfrastructure for advanced spatial analysis and modeling. I'm currently studying for a PhD student in Spatial Informatics under Dr. Shaowen Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My work on reproducible computation in the geosciences lead to a redesign of [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/) and  [CyberGIS-Jupyter for Water (CJW)](https://go.illinois.edu/cybergis-jupyter-water/) and my work on rapidly measuring spatial accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic was deployed as part of the [WhereCOVID-19 Spatial Accessibility Explorer](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/spatialAccess.html).
